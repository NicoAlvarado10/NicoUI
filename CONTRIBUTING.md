# Contributing to NicoUI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **NicoUI**! This project is a collection of components designed to work with various frontend frameworks and uses **Tailwind CSS** and **Remixicon**. To maintain consistency and functionality across frameworks, we have established certain guidelines for creating new components.

## Contribution Guide
### 1. Creating New Components
If you want to add a new component, follow these steps:

- **Multiple Frameworks**: Ensure that you implement the component in **all frameworks supported by NicoUI** (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
- **Visual Consistency**: The design should be consistent and adhere to the use of **Tailwind CSS** and **Remixicon**.

### 2. Adding a New Feature
If you want to add a new feature (e.g., improve an existing component or add a global feature), follow these steps:

1. **Open an Issue**:
   - Before you start working, open an issue to describe the new feature you want to add. This will allow the maintainers to discuss the proposal and ensure it aligns with the project's vision.
   - Include details such as the problem the feature solves, usage examples, and any relevant references.

2. **Proposal Approval**:
   - Wait for the maintainers to approve the issue before you start working.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Create a new branch for your work (`feature/new-feature-name`).
   - Develop the feature so that it can be integrated with all relevant components and frameworks.
   - Ensure your code is documented and follows the project's conventions.

4. **Testing**:
   - Perform tests to ensure the feature works correctly in all frameworks.
   - If necessary, create or update automated tests.

5. **Submitting the Pull Request**:
   - Make a descriptive commit of the changes.
   - Submit a detailed pull request explaining the feature and how to use it, along with the code changes and tests performed.

### 3. Setting Up the Development Environment
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NicoAlvarado10/NicoUI.git
   cd nicoui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

The project maintainers will review your pull request and may request changes to ensure the project's quality.
